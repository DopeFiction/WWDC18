# WWDC18 (ACCEPTED)
This is my scholarship submission for ï£¿ WWDC18  Hope you have fun playing and learning :)

If you like clean and beautiful Swift-Code, I highly recommend that you don't worry about mine too much. Since we only had a few weeks of time and I did most coding late at night it partly really is aweful to look at. 
I tried to beautify it at least a bit, but I gave up, given the low capabilities of playgound-debugging.

If you have any questions about anything just HMU..

UPDATE: I actually got in! Still can't belive it :DD I'm so exited to see all you all in SJ, CA ^-*


Also, I made a youtube video. In case you haven't seen it yet check it out:
