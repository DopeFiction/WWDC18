 Well done.
 Let's get real now:
 My idea for this year: [Tic-Tac-Toe](glossary://Tic-Tac-Toe)
 but not just any, nooo... **3D Tic-Tac-Toe**!
 
 ## Rules are simple:
 1. Tap the screen to throw a ball.
 2. Each time you hit a block you will hear a sound. If you miss, it's the next players turn.
 3. If you get a "3 in a row", you get a point.
 4. Whoever first has 3 points wins the game!
 
 * callout(Notice):
 Similar to the last page you can [customize](glossary://customize) the `playerNames` and `playerColors` [arrays](glossary://array). By doing that you can also change the number of players ðŸ˜‰
 Keep in mind tho that both arrays need the same number of items in order to [setup](glossary://setup) the game.

Thank you very much for playing and have a wonderful day! ^-^
